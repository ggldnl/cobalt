# Hardware test

Files contained in the `raw` folder contain examples on the basic operating logic of sensors/devices. No libraries are used in this case and all the functions that control the hardware are hardcoded inside the very same test file.
Files contained in the `lib` folder contain examples on how to use the libraries that will be used in the ROS node.
